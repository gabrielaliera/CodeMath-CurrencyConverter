# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Gabriela Liera**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

**ATM Withdrawal Converter** is an android app that is designed to calculate the USD amount of an ATM withdrawal made in Japan. Generally, when making an ATM withdrawal, there are two fees to consider: the fee charged by the ATM and the fee charged by the user's personal bank. In Japan, the ATM fee varies depending on the time of day of the transaction. During business hours, the cash withdrawal fee is standardized at 110 JPY, while outside of business hours, it is 220 JPY.

With this app, users can input the desired amount in Japanese yen (¬•), select the ATM fee, input the withdrawal fee charged by their personal bank, and the app will calculate the total cost in USD.

## Notes

While traveling, I often worried about how much money I could withdraw from my bank account while factoring in the associated fees. To address this problem during my trip to Japan, I created an app that calculates the total cost of an ATM withdrawal, taking into account both the ATM fee and the fee charged by the user's personal bank. As of March 22, 2023, the exchange rate is 1 USD to 132.61 JPY.

Developing this app allowed me to learn how to create a utility app from scratch. I gained knowledge on how to handle user interaction, which involved understanding the various ways in which users can interact with the app and responding appropriately. Additionally, I learned how to process user input, which involved validating, parsing, and storing user input.

Moreover, I became familiar with ViewBinding, a useful feature that can reduce boilerplate code and increase efficiency in app development. By generating a binding class that allows access to all the views in the app layout, ViewBinding makes it easier to reference and manipulate them in the code.

Finally, I learned about using logcat to debug the app. Logcat is a valuable tool provided by Android Studio that displays the system logs, allowing developers to monitor their app's behavior, identify potential issues, and debug the app's code more efficiently.
